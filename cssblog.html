<h2>This is my first article</h2>

<p class="firstpara">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about. What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it! Across the sea of space, the stars are other suns. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.</p>

<p>The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class. We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.</p>

<p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space. The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class.</p>

<h2>This is my second article</h2>

<p class="firstpara">I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine. The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.</p>

<p>I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets. The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest. The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.</p>

<p>Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program. It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.</p>

<p>When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it! We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.</p>
